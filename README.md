# JavaScript
 
This project aims to build a website which creates a table dynamically based upon UFO dataset provided. It allows users to filter the table data for specific values. It uses pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on web pages.

Main objectives are:

  - Create a basic HTML web page as landing page.
  - Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
  - A column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment when displaying data in table.
  - A date form that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
  - Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
   
   date/time
   
   city
   
   state
   
   country
   
   shape
